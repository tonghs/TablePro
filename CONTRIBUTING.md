# Contributing to TablePro

## Setup

Requirements: macOS 14.0+, Xcode 15+. Optional: SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, GitHub CLI (`gh`).

Fork the repo on GitHub, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/TablePro.git && cd TablePro
scripts/download-libs.sh
touch Secrets.xcconfig
brew install swiftlint swiftformat
```

If you're signing the Debug build with a non-official Apple Developer team (e.g. a free personal team), three things in the project file are tied to the official team and need a one-time local override in Xcode. Open `TablePro.xcodeproj`, select the `TablePro` target, then:

1. **Team**: Signing & Capabilities tab → click the **Debug** sub-tab at the top (so the change scopes to Debug only) → set Team to your personal team.
2. **Bundle Identifier**: same Debug sub-tab → change `com.TablePro` to something unique under your team (e.g. `com.<yourhandle>.TablePro`). The default `com.TablePro` is reserved for the official team in Apple's developer portal.
3. **Entitlements**: Build Settings tab → search "Code Signing Entitlements" → in the **Debug** row, change `TablePro/TablePro.entitlements` to `TablePro/TablePro.Debug.entitlements`. This second file already ships with the repo (you don't need to create it); it is identical to the default minus the iCloud keys, which free personal teams don't support. iCloud sync is automatically disabled at runtime when the entitlement is absent.

These changes will appear in `TablePro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. **Don't commit them**, or you'll break the official Release signing. Either revert with `git checkout TablePro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` before every commit, or run `git update-index --skip-worktree TablePro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` once to make git ignore your local changes to that file. Release builds and official-team Debug builds keep using `com.TablePro` and `TablePro/TablePro.entitlements` unchanged.

Verify the setup by saving a database connection with a password, quitting and relaunching the app, then re-opening the connection: the password should still be there.

Build:

```bash
xcodebuild -project TablePro.xcodeproj -scheme TablePro -configuration Debug build -skipPackagePluginValidation
```

Tests:

```bash
xcodebuild -project TablePro.xcodeproj -scheme TablePro test -skipPackagePluginValidation
```

## Code Style

`.swiftlint.yml` and `.swiftformat` are the source of truth. The short version:

- 4-space indent, 120-char lines
- Explicit access control (`private`, `internal`, `public`)
- No force unwraps (`!`) or force casts (`as!`)
- `String(localized:)` for user-facing strings
- OSLog only, no `print()`

Before committing:

```bash
swiftlint lint --strict
swiftformat .
```

## Adding a Database Driver

Drivers are `.tableplugin` bundles loaded at runtime. Create a new bundle under `Plugins/`, implement `DriverPlugin` + `PluginDatabaseDriver` from `TableProPluginKit`, and add the target to the Xcode project.
